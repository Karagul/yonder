```{r, child = "_setup.Rmd"}
```

### Getting started

```{r}
card(
  .style %>%
    border("info") %>%
    width(50),
  header = "Please pick a flavor",
  formInput(
    id = "form1",
    formGroup(
      label = "Ice creams",
      radioInput(
        id = "flavor",
        choices = c("Mint", "Moose tracks", "Marble"),
      )
    ),
    formSubmit(
      .style %>% background("info"),
      label = "Make choice",
      value = "choice"
    )
  )
)
```

### Inline forms

When `inline` is `TRUE` you may want to adjust the right margin of each child
element for viewports larger than mobile, `margin(right = c(sm = 2))`, see
[margin()]. You only need to apply extra space for larger viewports because
inline forms do not take effect on small viewports.
